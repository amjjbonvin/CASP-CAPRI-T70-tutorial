Our information-driven docking approach [HADDOCK](http://www.bonvinlab.org/software/haddock2.2) is a consistent top predictor and scorer since the start of its participation in the [CAPRI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/capri) community-wide experiment. This sustained performance is due, in part, to its ability to integrate experimental data and/or bioinformatics information into the modelling process, and also to the overall robustness of the scoring function used to assess and rank the predictions. 

This tutorial will demonstrate the use of HADDOCK for predicting target70 of the CASP-CAPRI experiment. This target was given to the CAPRI community as a tetramer, but there has been discussions whether the biological unit is a dimer or a tetramer. We will use this target to illustrate the ab-initio docking mode of HADDOCK, using a combination of [center-of-mass restraints](http://www.bonvinlab.org/software/haddock2.2/run/#disre) to bring the subunits together and [symmetry restraints](http://www.bonvinlab.org/software/haddock2.2/run/#sym) to define the symmetry of the assembly.

The tutorial is described on our web page at: [http://www.bonvinlab.org/education/HADDOCK-CASP-CAPRI-T70/](http://www.bonvinlab.org/education/HADDOCK-CASP-CAPRI-T70/)
